I'm currently studying Computer Science at Western Sydney University, and\r\n                working as a web developer. I love working on programming and web projects in my spare time, most of\r\n                which are on my <a href=\"https://github.com/SamLeatherdale\">GitHub page</a>.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>In 2015 - 2016, I was a student of the Western Sydney Institute of TAFE NSW, Australia, where I studied\r\n                the Certificate IV in Programming, the Certificate IV in Web Based Technologies, and the Diploma of\r\n                Information Technology. During my time at TAFE, I won the Student of the Year award for Information\r\n                Technology.
