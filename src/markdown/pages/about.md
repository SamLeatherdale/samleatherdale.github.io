# About Me

Hi, I'm Sam Leatherdale. 

I'm a recent graduate of the Bachelor off Computer Science at Western Sydney University, and I'm currently working as a web developer.
I love working on programming and web projects in my spare time, most of which are showcased here on the home page, or can be found on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/SamLeatherdale).
    
In 2015 - 2016, I was a student of the Western Sydney Institute of TAFE NSW, Australia, where I studied the Certificate IV in Programming, the Certificate IV in Web Based Technologies, and the Diploma of Information Technology. During my time at TAFE, I won the Student of the Year award for Information Technology. You can see the promo video created for the event below:

# Technologies
I love learning new web technologies constantly. I use these ones the most:

* HTML5 and CSS (SASS/SCSS)
* JavaScript (Node, React, TypeScript and jQuery)
* PHP
* MySQL/MariaDB
* Python

I also have experience with the following technologies:
* C#/ASP.NET
* SQL Server
* Java

# Achievements
In October 2016, I won the WorldSkills National competition for Web Development. It was a tough 3 day competition and skills including original webpage design, client-side scripting, server-side programming, database creation and interaction, and Photoshop/Illustrator design were tested.

I also attended the National Computer Science School at the University of Sydney in January 2016.
