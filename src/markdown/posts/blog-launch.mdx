I've finally gotten around to launching a blog on my portfolio website. This website has been through many iterations and changes, first as a WordPress blog, then as a series of HTML pages that I "statically compiled" using a PHP script, before static site generators were all the rage, and finally a Gatsby site.

It'll be good to have one place to keep all the content that's safely revisioned and backed up to GitHub's servers. Maybe my blog will even be included in the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o)!
