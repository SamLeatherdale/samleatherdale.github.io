I have been training for many months to prepare for the WorldSkills competition. Right before I headed off, it was great to go to this award ceremony held by TAFE, and to meet our local member Trish Doyle.

Two articles were published:
- The first article was about the ceremony, published on the [Blue Mountains Australia website](http://www.bluemts.com.au/news/blue-mountains-tafe-excellence-acknowledged). 
- The second article was about the preparation for the National competition, published by the [Blue Mountains Gazette](https://www.bluemountainsgazette.com.au/story/4119806/tafe-skills-tested).
